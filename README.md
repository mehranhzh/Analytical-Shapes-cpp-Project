#Analytical Shapes
The current aim is to make every surface of a primitive triangulated. The vertices of these triangles will be stored into a vector called Points. The information a .stl file needs will calculated in the Triangle and 3D primitive class, such as normal vector of a triangle and the coordinates of its vertices. Then use the stlWriter to output the information of these vertices to get the STL files.

Although the final presentation has past, we are working on the extruding Bezier and 3D objects intersection, union and difference.
Attention will also be paid on the optimization of some wired number and bugs.
